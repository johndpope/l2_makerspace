# CNC Plasma Cutter Automation

## Purpose

Automate the loading/unloading/cutting cycle of traditional CNC subtractive machining. 

This includes CNC milling and plasma cutting, but also extends to e.g. fabric cutting.

## Ideas

Automate toolpath generation to cut out a part. This would borrow strongly from the "reverse engineering" work in ../optimize.
