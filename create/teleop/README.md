# Teleoperated robotic workspace

## Purpose

Create a physical working area that is controllable in VR.

## Ideas

- Buy a robotic arm, make it work with IK based on user moving a virtual pendant
- Contract out "VR assembly" work to Fiverr to perform simple operations (E.g. clearing a 3D printer bed, assembling a PCB)
- Use captured motion data from these tasks to drive automation of the same
