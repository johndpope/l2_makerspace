# L2 publishing automation

## Purpose

Automate as much of the manual work in publishing a finished project as possible.

## Ideas

Every project should have:

1. A link to a git repository containing all small-size materials/artefacts
1. A link to a video demo reel (a couple minutes describing the project)
1. At least one markdown file describing the steps to complete the project
   *  This file should have a standard format - purpose, step-by-step instructions, etc. Could pull from prior Fabricate instructables for insight.

Ways to make this easy:

1. We could hire out to make a first pass at the documentation based on video, repository code, basic TL;DR instructions etc.
1. Assuming a standard format for the markdown file, it can automatically translated into instructable format.
1. Timelapse cameras should be positioned around the space, as well as movable cameras for ease of video documentation of activity in the space.
   *  On project completion, all the video gets schlepped off to Fiverr and someone builds a montage.
