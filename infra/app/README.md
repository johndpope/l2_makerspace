# L2 Makerspace App

## Purpose

Provide an easy interface and "controller" for the L2 makerspace and a user's projects.

## Instructions

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

It will then be available at `localhost:5000`. For production-optimized builds, get your server to run:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Ideas

- Add cordova support to have native app
- Detect nearest bluetooth beacon to give an idea of location
- Talk via websocket bridge to ROS2 network
- Send active project & whether in the makerspace
