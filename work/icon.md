# Makerspace icons

## Objective 

Create a set of 3 icons that can be used to describe the different stages of making, as separate SVGs.

**Guidelines**

*    Must include elements of problem identification, solution finding/optimization, and automation in manufacturing. Hexagonal panels for each?
*    Each icon separately should look incomplete/attachable.
