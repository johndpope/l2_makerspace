# Textile Optimization

## Purpose

Optimize designs of outfits / fabric projects - reducing the materials used, time to build, and other user specified parameters.

## Ideas

- Learn how to use https://wiki.valentinaproject.org/wiki/Main_Page ("Seamly2D"), an open-source sewing drafting app.
- Find ways to derive common optimization metrics (see "Purpose")
- Expose API hooks that can be driven by automation (e.g. tensorflow)
- Pull example patterns from https://my-pattern.cloud/ and build a "mixer" that mixes existing patterns
