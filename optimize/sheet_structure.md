# Sheet Structure Optimization

## Purpose

Automate the design of folded / joined sheets of material into structures based on user constraints (cost, weight, strength etc)

## Ideas

- Look at past research into origami algorithms: http://www.generativedesigncomputing.net/2011/10/origami-rhinoscript-python.html?m=1
- Download https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/SheetMetal_Workbench and figure out how to use API
- Derive metrics (weight, materials cost etc) from folded and unfolded design.
