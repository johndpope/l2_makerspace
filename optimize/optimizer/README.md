# Generic design optimization framework

## Purpose

Allow mix-and-match application of optimizers in this directory, and present a common API for doing this. 

## Example Problems

"I want to build an upholstered chair that can comfortably hold 200lb and fit in <weird shaped room location>
that's easy to clean"

"I want to 3D print plates onto fabric armor to make <shape> when it's worn"

"I want to build a robotic armature that animates a fabric creature"

## Ideas
