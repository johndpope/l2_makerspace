# Reverse Engineering Tool for 3D structures

## Purpose

When given a 3D model (e.g. STL file) come up with the most likely set of techniques used to produce it. 

A simpler version of this problem: given a 3d model made by a single tool (and the tool used), determine
what operations would produce a matching part.
