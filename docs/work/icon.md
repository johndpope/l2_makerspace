# Makerspace icons

## Objective 

Create a set of 3 icons that can be used to describe the different stages of making, as separate SVGs.

**Guidelines**

*  The icons must be separate files, but can be assembled together into a single icon that could also be used as a menu.
*  Each icon separately should look incomplete/attachable, i.e. part of a larger set.

* Icon 1 (green): supposed to look like nodes in a graph
* Icon 2 (blue): looks like a descending timeseries plot
* Icon 3 (orange): looks like the traces in a circuit board
