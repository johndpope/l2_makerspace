# L2 Makerspace Docs Stack


## Requirements



*   Markdown is the primary method of documenting things
    *   Can also use [https://remarkjs.com/](https://remarkjs.com/) for markdown-driven slides.
    *   Need a common template "design doc" that can be auto-filled with the L2 app.
*   READMEs from each project are aggregated so they can be displayed on a webpage.
*   Every project should aim to have some kind of ~2min video that showcases it once the project is finished.
    *   This video can be compiled by the maker, or it can be fiverr'd out. 
    *   Can use the time lapse or other camera video stuff
*   When the project is finished, it should be as close to a single button-press or single runnable command as possible to replicate the project results. E.g. "wget ... | sh" which either installs/runs on docker natively, or starts up a google kubernetes instance on the user's behalf like google's [AI Hub](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hub/).


## User journeys

User starts a new project



*   Record a 1-2 minute brief outline ("testimonial" style) of what's being attempted
*   Acquire (possibly contract) reference images
*   Fiverr up a person to organize/upload the video and images, do a quick writeup and add it as a README to the github repository.

User stops working on a project



*   Record a quick 5-10 second video log of the state of things with enough details that it can be transcribed.
*   Add any notes to the readme/markdown files in the github repository (app will remind)

User finishes a project



*   Compile a showcase video from all recordings of the project
*   Complete a writeup that allows for turn-key replication of the project.
